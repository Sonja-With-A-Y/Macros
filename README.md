# Macros
An attempt to make a program that allows Vim style macros outside of Vim.

I want to press a hotkey followed by a letter, then press a bunch of keys that are recorded into [letter].txt until I hit the hotkey again.

I then want to hit a different hotkey followed by the letter, and that should play that macro.

Currently not working.
